  Many web applications expose database ids of domain objects in their urls as a way to easily access
  these objects. Most web frameworks default to using sequential ids, which can result in exposing
  sensitive business data, such as total number of users.
</p>

<p>
  Using UUIDs is one way to solve this problem, but it is often convenient for ids to be short and easily
  pronounceable. We can use the following method to produce 10 digit non-sequential numbers which have the
  advantage of being pronounceable. Let's start by creating a sequence.
</p>

<pre>
CREATE SEQUENCE id_seq;
</pre>

<p>
  We'll use the fact that if <code>p</code> is a prime number, then <code>a % p</code> is equal to
  <code>b % p</code> if and only if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are equal. A quick search tells us that
  <code>999999937</code> is the largest 10 digit prime, and we can pick another pair of large numbers,
  say <code>7369712273</code> and <code>1365089121</code> to generate a series of non-sequential numbers.
</p>

<pre>
CREATE FUNCTION fetch_id(text) RETURNS bigint AS
  'select 7369712273 * nextval($1) + 1365089121 % 999999937;'
  LANGUAGE SQL
  IMMUTABLE
  RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT;
</pre>

<p>
  Note that the numbers generated but this function are not truly random, so this might not be the best way
  to generate ids for extremely sensitive information. Now we can create our users table.
</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE users
  (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT fetch_id('id_seq'),
    email VARCHAR
  );
</pre>

<p>
  If we insert a few users into our table, we see that we end up with a nice series of non-sequential ids.
</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('test1@example.com');
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('test2@example.com');
INSERT INTO users (email) VALUES ('test3@example.com');
</pre>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM USERS;
     id      |       email
-------------+--------------------
  7734801457 | test1@example.com
 15104513730 | test2@example.com
 22474226003 | test3@example.com
</pre>
