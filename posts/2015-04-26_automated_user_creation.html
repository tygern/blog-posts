  When developing a web application it is crucial to be able to efficiently click-test.
  Even with a comprehensive test suite, click-testing edge cases is a useful tool when
  driving out a feature. However, click-testing can often be time consuming, especially
  when a complex set of objects must be created to test the desired feature. To help
  speed thing up, I like to create scripts in javascript to automate as much of this
  process as possible.
</p>

<p>
  User signup is often a bottleneck in click-testing. This step often requires inputting
  a large amount information, some of which cannot conflict with other users' information.
  In these situations I like to use timestamps to ensure uniqueness, and the browser's
  local storage to keep track of created users.
</p>

<pre>
var timestamp = (new Date()).getTime();
var username = 'user-' + timestamp;

var users = localStorage.getItem("users");

if (users) {
  users = users + "," + username;
} else {
  users = username;
}

localStorage.setItem("users", users);

document.getElementById('username').value = username;
document.getElementById('password').value = 'testing123';
document.getElementById('email').value = userName + '@example.com';

document.getElementById('firstName').value = 'Test';
document.getElementById('lastName').value = 'User';

document.getElementById('submitButton').focus();
</pre>

<p>
  We see that the inclusion of the timestamp in the username and email ensure that our created
  user is unique, and that our user is persisted in a users string in local storage. Now if we
  want to log in as our created user we can use the following script.
</p>

<pre>
var users = localStorage.getItem("users");

if (users) {
  username = users.split(",").slice(-1)[0];
  document.getElementById('username').value = username;
  document.getElementById('password').value = 'testing123';

  document.getElementById('submitButton').focus();
}
</pre>

<p>
  To see a list of users that we've created we can run,
</p>

<pre>
var users = localStorage.getItem("users");

if (users) {
  users = users.split(",");
} else {
  users = "no users stored";
}

console.log(users);
</pre>

<p>
  and to delete all create users we can run,
</p>

<pre>
localStorage.removeItem("users");
</pre>

<p>
  Each of these scrips can be added to Chrome as a bookmark by collapsing the script to one
  line and appending with <code>javescript:</code>. This way we can create a Chrome profile
  for our applicaiton and share scripts between developers. We can make these scripts even
  easier to call by creating a search engine (Chrome allows search engines to be called by
  shortcuts in the location bar). Simply paste the same url from the bookmark into the search
  engine url, and type a shortcut into the keyword field. Then we can run our scripts without
  taking our hands off the keyboard.
