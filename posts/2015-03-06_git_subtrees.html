  This blog was created using the
  <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular">Yeoman angular generator</a>
  and is deployed to <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. The
  <a href="https://github.com/tygern/gistblog">source repo</a> is hosted on GitHub, and the
  posts are hosted in a
  <a href="https://github.com/tygern/blog-posts"></a>separate repository.
</p>

<p>
  In order to take advantage of Grunt asset concatination and minification I didn't want
  to serve the entire source on GitHub Pages, but rather only serve content in the
  <code>/dist</code> subdirectory of the repo. To accomplish this, I pushed a
  <strong>git subtree</strong> of my main repo to my
  <a href="https://github.com/tygern/tygern.github.io">GitHub Pages repo</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Before doing this, make sure your <code>/dist</code> directory (or wherever your
  build site is located) is not in your <code>.gitignore</code> file, and that you have
  created a <em>username</em>.github.io repository.
</p>

<pre>
git remote add ghpages \
  https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[USERNAME].github.io.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deploy to GitHub Pages"
git subtree push --prefix dist gh-pages master
</pre>

<p>
  This method of deploying a subfolder using git might also be useful for heroku deploys
  where the server and webclient live in the same repo, but are deployed separately.
</p>

<pre>
my_application/
  server/
  client/
</pre>

<p>
  Many heroku buildpacks require your app to be located in the root of your repository,
  which is a problem if your repository also contains your webclient. This problem could
  easily be solved by deploying a git subtree to your heroku remote.

<pre>
git subtree push --prefix server heroku master
