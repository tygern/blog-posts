  When working on web projects it is often necessary to integrate with an external service,
  such as Stripe or Twitter. It is important to be able to integration test these services
  so that we can be confident that our integrations are working. While many web services
  provide testing environments, it is easy to clutter our integrations when we are running
  test, development, acceptance, staging, and production environments.

  I've developed a pattern that I like to use in a Capybara test suite to handle testing
  external services and facilitating the cleanup. Suppose we are integrating with
  a (ficticious) zervice called Zippy, which manages our users' accounts, using a
  <code>Zippy</code> gem. I'd start by putting the following class in
  <code>spec/support</code>
</p>

<pre>
class ZippyEnvironment
  def initialize
    @account_ids = []
    yield self
  ensure
    clean_up
  end

  def create_account(data)
    account = Zippy::Account.create(data)

    if account.errors.empty?
      @account_ids << account.id
    else
      raise "Failed to create account due to #{account.errors.inspect}"
    end

    account
  end

  private

  def clean_up
    delete_accounts
  end

  def delete_accounts
    failed_deletions = []

    @account_ids.each do |id|
      success = Zippy::Account.delete(id)
      failed_deletions << id unless success
    end

    raise "Failed to delete accounts #{failed_deletions.inspect}" unless failed_deletions.empty?
  end
end
</pre>

<p>
  Then I could use the <code>ZippyEnvironment</code> in my Capybara tests to ensure cleanup.
</p>

<pre>
describe "Some feature" do
  it "behaves as expected" do
    ZippyEnvironment.new do |zippy|
      account = zippy.create_account(name: "Pat", email: "pat@example.com")

      # test your feature here
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<p>
  As long as I put my test code within the <code>ZippyEnvironment</code> block, I'm assured
  that I have access to my Zippy user and that the user will be removed when the test
  is completed. Note that since we are using <code>ensure</code> we are assured that
  users will be deleted even if the test fails or if an exception is raised.
